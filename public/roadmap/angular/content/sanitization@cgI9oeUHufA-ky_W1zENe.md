# Sanitization

Sanitization is the inspection of an untrusted value, turning it into a value that's safe to insert into the DOM. In many cases, sanitization doesn't change a value at all. Sanitization depends on context: A value that's harmless in CSS is potentially dangerous in a URL.

Angular sanitizes untrusted values for HTML and URLs. Sanitizing resource URLs isn't possible because they contain arbitrary code. In development mode, Angular prints a console warning when it has to change a value during sanitization.

Interpolated content is always escaped â€”the HTML isn't interpreted and the browser displays angle brackets in the element's text content.

For the HTML to be interpreted, bind it to an HTML property such as `innerHTML`. Be aware that binding a value that an attacker might control into `innerHTML` normally causes an XSS vulnerability.
