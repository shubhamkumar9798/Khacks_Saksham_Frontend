# Module Architecture

Angularâ€™s module architecture organizes an application into cohesive units called NgModules, each defined by the @NgModule decorator. These modules group related components, directives, pipes, and services to encapsulate functionality and promote modular development. The root module (AppModule) is the entry point, bootstrapping the application and importing essential modules like BrowserModule. Feature modules encapsulate specific functionalities and can be eagerly or lazily loaded to improve performance and manageability. Shared modules group reusable components and services to prevent code duplication. The @NgModule metadata includes properties like imports, declarations, exports, providers, and bootstrap, which help manage dependencies, declarations, visibility, service providers, and the root component. This modular approach enhances code organization, scalability, and maintainability in Angular applications.
