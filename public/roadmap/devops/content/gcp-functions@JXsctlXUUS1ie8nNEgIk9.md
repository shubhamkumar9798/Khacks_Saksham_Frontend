# GCP Cloud Functions

Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. It allows developers to write single-purpose, standalone functions that respond to cloud events without the need to manage a server or runtime environment. These functions can be triggered by various events from Google Cloud services, HTTP requests, or Firebase features. Cloud Functions automatically scale based on the workload, and users are charged only for the compute time used. They support multiple programming languages including Node.js, Python, and Go. Cloud Functions are commonly used for real-time data processing, webhooks, lightweight APIs, and integrating systems in a microservices architecture. This service enables rapid development and deployment of code in the Google Cloud ecosystem.
