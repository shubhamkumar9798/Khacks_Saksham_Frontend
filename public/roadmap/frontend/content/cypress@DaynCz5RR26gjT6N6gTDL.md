Cypress framework is a JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework built on top of Mocha â€“ a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and convenient. It also uses a BDD/TDD assertion library and a browser to pair with any JavaScript testing framework.
