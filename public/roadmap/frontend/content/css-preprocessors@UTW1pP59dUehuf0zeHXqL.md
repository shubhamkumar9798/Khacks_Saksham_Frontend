# CSS Preprocessors

CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the capabilities of standard CSS, allowing developers to write more maintainable and efficient stylesheets. They introduce features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and mathematical operations, which are then compiled into standard CSS. Popular preprocessors include Sass, Less, and Stylus. These tools enable developers to organize styles more logically, reuse code more effectively, and create complex CSS structures with less repetition. Preprocessors often support features like partials for modular stylesheets and built-in color manipulation functions. By using a preprocessor, developers can write more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, manage large-scale projects more easily, and potentially improve the performance of their stylesheets through optimization during the compilation process.
