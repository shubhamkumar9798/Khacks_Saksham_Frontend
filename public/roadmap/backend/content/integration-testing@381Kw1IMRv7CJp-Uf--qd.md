# Integration Testing

Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or modules of a software system to ensure they work together as expected. It comes after unit testing and tests how modules communicate with each other, often using APIs, databases, or third-party services. The goal is to catch issues related to the integration points, such as data mismatches, protocol errors, or misconfigurations. Integration tests help ensure that independently developed components can function seamlessly as part of a larger system, making them crucial for identifying bugs that wouldn't surface in isolated unit tests.
