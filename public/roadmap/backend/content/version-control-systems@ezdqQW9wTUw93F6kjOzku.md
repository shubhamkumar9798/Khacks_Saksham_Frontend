# Version Control Systems

Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that manage and track changes to code or documents over time, allowing multiple users to collaborate on a project efficiently. They record every change made to files, enabling developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and maintain a history of modifications. VCS can be centralized, where the repository is hosted on a central server (e.g., Subversion), or distributed, where each user has a complete copy of the repository (e.g., Git, Mercurial). Version control facilitates collaboration, enhances code integrity, and supports continuous integration by enabling smooth management of concurrent changes and resolving conflicts.
