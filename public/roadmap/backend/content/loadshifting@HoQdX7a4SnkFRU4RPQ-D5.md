# Load Shifting

Load shifting is a strategy used to manage and distribute computing or system workloads more efficiently by moving or redistributing the load from peak times to off-peak periods. This approach helps in balancing the demand on resources, optimizing performance, and reducing costs. In cloud computing and data centers, load shifting can involve rescheduling jobs, leveraging different regions or availability zones, or adjusting resource allocation based on real-time demand. By smoothing out peak loads, organizations can enhance system reliability, minimize latency, and better utilize their infrastructure.
