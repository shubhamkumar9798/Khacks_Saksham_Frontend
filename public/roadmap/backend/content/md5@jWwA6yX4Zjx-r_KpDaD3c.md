# MD5

MD5 (Message-Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value, typically represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. It was designed to provide a unique identifier for data by generating a fixed-size output (the hash) for any input. While MD5 was once popular for verifying data integrity and storing passwords, it is now considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for security-sensitive applications due to vulnerabilities that allow for collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash). As a result, MD5 has largely been replaced by more secure hash functions like SHA-256.
