# Hosting

Hosting refers to the service of providing server space and resources for storing and delivering website files and applications to users over the internet. Hosting providers offer the infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and network connectivity, required to make websites and applications accessible online. There are various types of hosting, including shared hosting (where multiple websites share a single server), virtual private servers (VPS), dedicated hosting (where a single server is dedicated to one user), and cloud hosting (which uses a network of servers to provide scalable resources). Hosting services often include domain registration, security features, and technical support to ensure websites are reliably available and perform well.
