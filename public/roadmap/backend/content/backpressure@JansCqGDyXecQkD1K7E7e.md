# Backpressure

Back pressure is a flow control mechanism in systems processing asynchronous data streams, where the receiving component signals its capacity to handle incoming data to the sending component. This feedback loop prevents overwhelming the receiver with more data than it can process, ensuring system stability and optimal performance. In software systems, particularly those dealing with high-volume data or event-driven architectures, back pressure helps manage resource allocation, prevent memory overflows, and maintain responsiveness. It's commonly implemented in reactive programming, message queues, and streaming data processing systems. By allowing the receiver to control the flow of data, back pressure helps create more resilient, efficient systems that can gracefully handle varying loads and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.
