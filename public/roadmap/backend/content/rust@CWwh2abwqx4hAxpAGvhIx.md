# Rust

Rust is a systems programming language known for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency. It provides fine-grained control over system resources while ensuring memory safety without needing a garbage collector. Rust's ownership model enforces strict rules on how data is accessed and managed, preventing common issues like null pointer dereferences and data races. Its strong type system and modern features, such as pattern matching and concurrency support, make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from low-level systems programming to high-performance web servers and tools. Rust is gaining traction in both industry and open source for its reliability and efficiency.
