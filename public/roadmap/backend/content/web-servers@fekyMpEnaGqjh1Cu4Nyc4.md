# Web Servers

Web servers are software or hardware systems that handle requests from clients (usually web browsers) and serve web content, such as HTML pages, images, and other resources. They process incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests, interact with application servers or databases if needed, and send the appropriate response back to the client. Popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). Web servers are essential for hosting websites and web applications, managing traffic, and ensuring reliable access to online resources by handling concurrent connections, serving static and dynamic content, and providing security features like SSL/TLS encryption.
