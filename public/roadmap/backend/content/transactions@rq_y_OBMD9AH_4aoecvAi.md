# Transactions

In database systems, a transaction is a series of operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit to ensure data integrity and consistency. Transactions adhere to the ACID properties: Atomicity ensures all operations complete successfully or none are applied; Consistency maintains the database's valid state; Isolation prevents transactions from interfering with each other; and Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent. These properties collectively ensure that databases handle concurrent operations reliably and maintain accurate and consistent data even in the face of failures.
