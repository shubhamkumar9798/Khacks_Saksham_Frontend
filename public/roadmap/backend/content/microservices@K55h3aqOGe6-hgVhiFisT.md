# Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others via lightweight protocols, typically HTTP or messaging queues. This approach allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and resilience, as services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices also facilitate the use of diverse technologies and languages for different components, and they support continuous delivery and deployment. However, managing microservices involves complexity in terms of inter-service communication, data consistency, and deployment orchestration.
