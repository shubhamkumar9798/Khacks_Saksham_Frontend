# Web sockets

WebSockets provide a protocol for full-duplex, real-time communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, which requires multiple request-response cycles to exchange data, WebSockets establish a persistent connection that allows for continuous data exchange in both directions. This enables efficient real-time interactions, such as live chat, online gaming, and real-time updates on web pages. WebSocket connections start with an HTTP handshake, then upgrade to a WebSocket protocol, facilitating low-latency communication and reducing overhead compared to HTTP polling or long polling.
