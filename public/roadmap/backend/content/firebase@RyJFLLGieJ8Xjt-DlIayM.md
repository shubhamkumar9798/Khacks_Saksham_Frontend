Firebase is a comprehensive mobile and web application development platform owned by Google. It provides a suite of cloud-based services that simplify app development, hosting, and scaling. Key features include real-time database, cloud storage, authentication, hosting, cloud functions, and analytics. Firebase offers real-time synchronization, allowing data to be updated across clients instantly. Its authentication service supports multiple providers, including email/password, social media logins, and phone authentication.
