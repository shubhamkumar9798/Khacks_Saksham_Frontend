Oracle Base Database Service enables you to maintain absolute control over your data while using the combined capabilities of Oracle Database and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle Base Database Service offers database systems (DB systems) on virtual machines. They are available as single-node DB systems and multi-node RAC DB systems on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). You can manage these DB systems by using the OCI Console, the OCI API, the OCI CLI, the Database CLI (DBCLI), Enterprise Manager, or SQL Developer.
