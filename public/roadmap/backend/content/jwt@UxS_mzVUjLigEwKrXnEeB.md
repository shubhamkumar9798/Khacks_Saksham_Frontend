# JWT

JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It consists of three parts: a header (which specifies the token type and algorithm used for signing), a payload (which contains the claims or the data being transmitted), and a signature (which is used to verify the tokenâ€™s integrity and authenticity). JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization purposes, allowing users to securely transmit and validate their identity and permissions across web applications and APIs. They are compact, self-contained, and can be easily transmitted in HTTP headers, making them popular for modern web and mobile applications.
