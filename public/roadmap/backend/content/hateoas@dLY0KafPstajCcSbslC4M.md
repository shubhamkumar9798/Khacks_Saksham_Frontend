# Hateoas

HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State) is a constraint of RESTful architecture that allows clients to navigate an API dynamically through hypermedia links provided in responses. Instead of hard-coding URLs or endpoints, the client discovers available actions through these links, much like a web browser following links on a webpage. This enables greater flexibility and decouples clients from server-side changes, making the system more adaptable and scalable without breaking existing clients. It's a key element of REST's principle of statelessness and self-descriptive messages.
