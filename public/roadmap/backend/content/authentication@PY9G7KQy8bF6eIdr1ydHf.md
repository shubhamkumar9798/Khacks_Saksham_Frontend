# Authentication

API authentication is the process of verifying the identity of clients attempting to access an API, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can interact with the API's resources. Common methods include API keys, OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), basic authentication, and OpenID Connect. These techniques vary in complexity and security level, from simple token-based approaches to more sophisticated protocols that handle both authentication and authorization. API authentication protects sensitive data, prevents unauthorized access, enables usage tracking, and can provide granular control over resource access. The choice of authentication method depends on factors such as security requirements, types of clients, ease of implementation, and scalability needs. Implementing robust API authentication is crucial for maintaining the integrity, security, and controlled usage of web services and applications in modern, interconnected software ecosystems.
