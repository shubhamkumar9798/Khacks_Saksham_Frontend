# CouchDB

Apache CouchDB is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database. It uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API. Unlike a relational database, a CouchDB database does not store data and relationships in tables. Instead, each database is a collection of independent documents. Each document maintains its own data and self-contained schema.
