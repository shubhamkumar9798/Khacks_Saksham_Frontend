# OpenID

OpenID is an open standard for decentralized authentication that allows users to log in to multiple websites and applications using a single set of credentials, managed by an identity provider (IdP). It enables users to authenticate their identity through an external service, simplifying the login process and reducing the need for multiple usernames and passwords. OpenID typically works in conjunction with OAuth 2.0 for authorization, allowing users to grant access to their data while maintaining security. This approach enhances user convenience and streamlines identity management across various platforms.
