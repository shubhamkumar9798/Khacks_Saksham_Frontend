# Server Security

Server security involves protecting servers from threats and vulnerabilities to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and services they manage. Key practices include:

1. **Patch Management**: Regularly updating software and operating systems to fix vulnerabilities.
2. **Access Control**: Implementing strong authentication mechanisms and restricting access to authorized users only.
3. **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection**: Using firewalls to block unauthorized access and intrusion detection systems to monitor and respond to suspicious activities.
4. **Encryption**: Encrypting data both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
5. **Security Hardening**: Configuring servers with minimal services and features, applying security best practices to reduce the attack surface.
6. **Regular Backups**: Performing regular backups to ensure data can be restored in case of loss or corruption.
7. **Monitoring and Logging**: Continuously monitoring server activity and maintaining logs for auditing and detecting potential security incidents.
