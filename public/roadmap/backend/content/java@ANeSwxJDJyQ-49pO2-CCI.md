# Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, robustness, and scalability. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), Java follows the "write once, run anywhere" principle, allowing code to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's widely used for building large-scale enterprise applications, Android mobile apps, and web services. Java features automatic memory management (garbage collection), a vast standard library, and strong security features, making it a popular choice for backend systems, distributed applications, and cloud-based solutions.
