# Apache

Apache, officially known as the Apache HTTP Server, is a free, open-source web server software developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It's one of the most popular web servers worldwide, known for its robustness, flexibility, and extensive feature set. Apache supports a wide range of operating systems and can handle various content types and programming languages through its modular architecture. It offers features like virtual hosting, SSL/TLS support, and URL rewriting. Apache's configuration files allow for detailed customization of server behavior. While it has faced competition from newer alternatives like Nginx, especially in high-concurrency scenarios, Apache remains widely used due to its stability, comprehensive documentation, and large community support. It's particularly favored for its ability to integrate with other open-source technologies in the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) stack.
