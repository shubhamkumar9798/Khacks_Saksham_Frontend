# Throttling

Throttling is a technique used to control the rate at which requests or operations are processed, typically to prevent overloading a system or service. It involves setting limits on the number of requests a user or application can make within a specific time period. Throttling helps manage resource consumption, ensure fair usage, and maintain system stability by avoiding excessive load that could degrade performance or cause outages. It is commonly implemented in APIs, network services, and databases to balance demand, protect against abuse, and ensure consistent performance across users and services.
