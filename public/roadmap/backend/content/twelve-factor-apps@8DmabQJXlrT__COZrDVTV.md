# Twelve-Factor Apps

The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a set of principles for building modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications, particularly suited for cloud environments. It emphasizes best practices for developing applications in a way that facilitates portability, scalability, and ease of deployment. Key principles include:

1. **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in version control, with many deploys.
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
3. **Config**: Store configuration in the environment.
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Separate build and run stages.
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding.
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as streams of events.
12. **Admin Processes**: Run administrative or management tasks as one-off processes.
