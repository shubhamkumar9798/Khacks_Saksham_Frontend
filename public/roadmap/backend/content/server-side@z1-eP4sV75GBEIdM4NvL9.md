# Server side

Server-side caching is a technique used to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory on the server, reducing the need for repeated data retrieval or computation. This approach helps to speed up response times and reduce the load on databases and other backend services. Common methods include caching database query results, HTML fragments, and API responses. Popular server-side caching tools and technologies include Redis, Memcached, and built-in caching mechanisms in web frameworks. By efficiently managing and serving cached content, server-side caching enhances scalability and responsiveness of applications.
