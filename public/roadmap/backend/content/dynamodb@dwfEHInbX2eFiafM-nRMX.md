# DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers high-performance, scalable, and flexible data storage for applications of any scale. DynamoDB supports both key-value and document data models, providing fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It features automatic scaling, built-in security, backup and restore options, and global tables for multi-region deployment. DynamoDB excels in handling high-traffic web applications, gaming backends, mobile apps, and IoT solutions. It offers consistent single-digit millisecond latency at any scale and supports both strongly consistent and eventually consistent read models. With its integration into the AWS ecosystem, on-demand capacity mode, and support for transactions, DynamoDB is widely used for building highly responsive and scalable applications, particularly those with unpredictable workloads or requiring low-latency data access.
