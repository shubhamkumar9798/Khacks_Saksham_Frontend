# SOA

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern where software components, known as services, are designed to be reusable, loosely coupled, and interact over a network. Each service is a self-contained unit that performs a specific business function and communicates with other services through standardized protocols and data formats, such as HTTP and XML. SOA enables organizations to build scalable, flexible, and interoperable systems by allowing services to be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. This approach promotes modularity, easier integration of disparate systems, and agility in adapting to changing business requirements.
