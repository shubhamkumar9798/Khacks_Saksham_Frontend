# HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP designed to secure data transmission between a client (e.g., browser) and a server. It uses encryption through SSL/TLS protocols to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. This prevents sensitive information, like login credentials or payment details, from being intercepted or tampered with by attackers. HTTPS is essential for securing web applications and has become a standard for most websites, especially those handling user data, as it helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.
