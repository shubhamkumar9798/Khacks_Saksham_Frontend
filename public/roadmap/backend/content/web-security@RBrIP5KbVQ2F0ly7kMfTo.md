# Web Security Knowledge

Web security involves protecting web applications from threats and vulnerabilities to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Key practices include strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, using encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) for secure data transmission, and validating user inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Secure coding practices, effective session management, and regular updates and patching are crucial for maintaining security. Additionally, ongoing security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, helps identify and address potential weaknesses, safeguarding applications and maintaining user trust.
