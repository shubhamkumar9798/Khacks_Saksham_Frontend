# SHA family

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed to generate a fixed-size hash value from variable-sized input data, ensuring data integrity and security. SHA functions are used for tasks such as verifying data integrity, storing passwords securely, and creating digital signatures. The SHA family includes several versions, such as SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash value but is now considered weak due to vulnerabilities, while SHA-2, with hash sizes of 224, 256, 384, and 512 bits, offers stronger security. SHA-3 is the latest member, providing additional security features and flexibility.
