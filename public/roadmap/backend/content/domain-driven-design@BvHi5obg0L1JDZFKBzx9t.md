# Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on creating a deep understanding of the business domain and using this knowledge to inform the design of software systems. It emphasizes close collaboration between technical and domain experts to develop a shared language (ubiquitous language) and model that accurately represents the core concepts and processes of the business. DDD promotes organizing code around business concepts (bounded contexts), using rich domain models to encapsulate business logic, and separating the domain logic from infrastructure concerns. Key patterns in DDD include entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, and domain services. This approach aims to create more maintainable and flexible software systems that closely align with business needs and can evolve with changing requirements. DDD is particularly valuable for complex domains where traditional CRUD-based architectures may fall short in capturing the nuances and rules of the business.
