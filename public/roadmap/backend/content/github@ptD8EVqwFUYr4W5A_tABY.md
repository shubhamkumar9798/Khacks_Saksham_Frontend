# GitHub

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. Owned by Microsoft, it provides hosting for software development and offers features beyond basic Git functionality. GitHub includes tools for project management, code review, and social coding. Key features include repositories for storing code, pull requests for proposing and reviewing changes, issues for tracking bugs and tasks, and actions for automating workflows. It supports both public and private repositories, making it popular for open-source projects and private development. GitHub's collaborative features, like forking repositories and inline code comments, facilitate team development and community contributions. With its extensive integrations and large user base, GitHub has become a central hub for developers, serving as a portfolio, collaboration platform, and deployment tool for software projects of all sizes.
