# Observability

Observability refers to the ability to understand and monitor the internal state of a system based on its external outputs, such as metrics, logs, and traces. It encompasses collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data to gain insights into system performance, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues. Effective observability involves integrating these data sources to provide a comprehensive view of system behavior, enabling proactive management and rapid response to problems. It helps in understanding complex systems, improving reliability, and optimizing performance by making it easier to identify and address issues before they impact users.
