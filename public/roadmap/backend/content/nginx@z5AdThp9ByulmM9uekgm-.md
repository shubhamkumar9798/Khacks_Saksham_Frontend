# Nginx

Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server known for its efficiency, scalability, and low resource consumption. Originally developed as a web server, Nginx is also commonly used as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and mail proxy. It excels at handling a large number of concurrent connections due to its asynchronous, event-driven architecture. Nginx's features include support for serving static content, handling dynamic content through proxying to application servers, and providing SSL/TLS termination. Its modular design allows for extensive customization and integration with various applications and services, making it a popular choice for modern web infrastructures.
