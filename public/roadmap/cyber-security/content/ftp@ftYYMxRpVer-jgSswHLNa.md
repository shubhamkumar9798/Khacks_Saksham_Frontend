# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

FTP is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. Originally developed in the 1970s, it's one of the earliest protocols for transferring files between computers and remains widely used today.

FTP operates on a client-server model, where one computer acts as the client (the sender or requester) and the other acts as the server (the receiver or provider). The client initiates a connection to the server, usually by providing a username and password for authentication, and then requests a file transfer.
