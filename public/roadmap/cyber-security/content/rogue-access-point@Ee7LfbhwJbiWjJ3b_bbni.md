# Rogue Access Point

A Rogue Access Point (Rogue AP) is an unauthorized wireless access point installed on a secure network without the network administrator's knowledge or consent. These devices can be set up by malicious actors to intercept, steal, or manipulate network traffic, or by employees who unintentionally compromise network security by setting up their own wireless access points.
