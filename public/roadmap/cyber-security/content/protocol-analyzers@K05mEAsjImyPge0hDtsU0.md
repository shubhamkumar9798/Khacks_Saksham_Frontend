# Protocol Analyzers

**Protocol analyzers**, also known as network analyzers or packet sniffers, are tools used to capture, inspect, and analyze network traffic. They help diagnose network issues, troubleshoot performance problems, and ensure security by providing detailed insights into the data packets transmitted across a network. Protocol analyzers decode and display various network protocols, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and DNS, allowing users to understand communication patterns, detect anomalies, and identify potential vulnerabilities. Popular examples include Wireshark and tcpdump.
