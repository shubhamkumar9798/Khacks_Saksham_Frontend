# Private

A **private cloud** is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization, offering the same benefits as public clouds, such as scalability and self-service, but with greater control and customization. It is hosted either on-premises or by a third-party provider, and it ensures that the organization's data and applications are isolated from other entities. This setup enhances security and compliance, making it ideal for businesses with specific regulatory requirements or high-security needs.
