# Hypervisor

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is software or firmware that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting the underlying hardware. It allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine, each operating independently with its own operating system and applications. Hypervisors facilitate better resource utilization by allowing a physical server to host several virtual environments, optimizing hardware efficiency.

There are two types of hypervisors:
- **Type 1 hypervisor**, or bare-metal hypervisor, runs directly on the physical hardware without a host operating system. It provides better performance and is commonly used in enterprise environments. Examples include VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.
- **Type 2 hypervisor** runs on top of an existing operating system, relying on the host OS for resource management. These are typically used for personal or development purposes, with examples like VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.

Hypervisors are fundamental in cloud computing, virtualization, and server consolidation, allowing for flexible and efficient resource management and isolation between virtual environments.
