# IP

IP, or Internet Protocol, is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity that refers to the way data is transferred across networks, specifically the internet. It is a core component of the internet's architecture and serves as the primary building block for communication between devices connected to the network. An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network, like a computer or smartphone. It comprises a series of numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1). IP addresses can be either IPv4 (32-bit) or the newer IPv6 (128-bit) format, which provides more available addresses. They allow devices to send and receive data packets to and from other devices on the internet.
