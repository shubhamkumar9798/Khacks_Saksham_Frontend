# Public

A **public cloud** is a computing service offered by third-party providers over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, and applications are shared among multiple users or organizations. It is typically managed by the cloud service provider and offers scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of access, with users paying only for the resources they consume. Public clouds are ideal for businesses and individuals who need flexible, on-demand computing resources without the overhead of managing physical infrastructure. Popular examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
