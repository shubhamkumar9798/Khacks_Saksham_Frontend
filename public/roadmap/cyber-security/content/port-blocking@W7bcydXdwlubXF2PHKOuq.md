# Port Blocking

Port blocking is an essential practice in hardening the security of your network and devices. It involves restricting, filtering, or entirely denying access to specific network ports to minimize exposure to potential cyber threats. By limiting access to certain ports, you can effectively safeguard your systems against unauthorized access and reduce the likelihood of security breaches.
